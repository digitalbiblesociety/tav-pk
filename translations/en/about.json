Find-A-Bible also features links to print Bibles, print-on-demand Bibles, digital Bibles, audio Bibles, visual Bibles and Bible resources – in multiple formats.",
  "faq_why_fab_head": "Why was Find-A-Bible Created?",
  "faq_why_fab_body": "The mission of Find-A-Bible is to ensure that the world’s Bibles and great biblical resources are easily found and shared.

  "faq_how_fab_different_body": "Find-A-Bible is the single digital platform where the major Bible agencies of the world and their affiliates have agreed to collaborate together to ensure that all Bibles and biblical resources are easily discoverable – in every language. Find-A-Bible was built to be a convenient hub delivering fast, accurate, and relevant information with minimal user effort. Also, it serves as a reference point for Bible translation organizations seeking to discover what Bibles have or have not been published in a specific language.",

  "fab_head": "The Find-A-Bible Project",
  "fab_body": "Find-A-Bible is a collaborative project of the Forum of Bible Agencies International (FOBAI). Find-A-Bible is built to increase the Bible's accessibility and aims to facilitate access to God's Word in the languages of the world. Find-A-Bible is designed and maintained by the Digital Bible Society (DBS). For over 20 years, people have been searching for hard-to-find Bibles on the internet. They often stumble upon the Forum of Bible Agencies International (FOBAI) website and ask for help. Find-A-Bible is inteded to address this growing need. Members share data on available Bibles while FOBAI launched a data-driven website in 2006. The past decades have marked unprecedented growth in the Bible cause.  Scripture is being translated into new languages at record pace, audio Bibles and Gospel films are multiplying in ways never imagined, and the world continues to search for Bible resources in their own languages. In 2013, FOBAI commissioned a rebuild of Find-A-Bible to the Digital Bible Society. With a grant from BibleLeague of Canada, Find-A-Bible continues to grow.  Data has increased 800%. Several completely new data-driven versions have been created. Country and language data is expanding to include missional distribution and translation data.",
